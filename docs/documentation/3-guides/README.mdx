These guides take you through [installing](/documentation/3-guides/1-k8s-installation.md) and using Otterize.

Some of these guides walk you through solving specific use cases,
such as
- [network mapping your K8s cluster to see what services call what other services](/documentation/3-guides/2-k8s-mapping-pod-to-pod-calls.md),
- [automatically controlling K8s pod-to-pod access via network policies](/documentation/3-guides/3-k8s-ibac-via-network-policies.md),
- [rolling out mTLS for pod-to-pod authentication](/documentation/3-guides/5-k8s-mtls.md), and
- [easily and securely accessing Kafka with mTLS and ACLs](/documentation/3-guides/4-ibac-for-k8s-kafka/README.mdx).

You'll also find a guide for [implementing intent-based access control](/documentation/3-guides/6-implementing-ibac.md) in general,
for any use case, including **bootstrapping** intents files to get your team started,
and **gradually rolling it out** service-by-service or team-by-team.
