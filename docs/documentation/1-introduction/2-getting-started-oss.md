title: Getting started with Otterize OSS
---


It's easy to get started with Otterize, whether you have 5 minutes to go through a quick pre-built tutorial, 
or 10 minutes to try it on your own services. 
And after that, it's also easy to gradually roll it out to your environments and your teams; 
we do *not* recommend turning intent-based access control into a big, time-consuming project!

# Got 5 minutes?

All you need is a Kubernetes cluster where you have admin rights, along with the standard Kubernetes toolset:
* `kubectl`
* Helm

And with that -- onwards to our quick tutorials!

How do I get a DocCardList that generates DocCards from a *different* category --
namely, the Quick Tutorials category?
:::
<!--
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList'
import {findSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common'
<DocCardList items={findSidebarCategory({href: "quick-tutorials"}).items}/>
-->
