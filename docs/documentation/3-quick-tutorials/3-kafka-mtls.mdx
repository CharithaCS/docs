# Kafka + mTLS

This tutorial will walk you through applying intents and deploying mTLS certificates between a client and a Kafka cluster
and configuring intents for one of its clients.
We will:

- Install Otterize
- Learn how to configure bitnami's kafka chart to use Otterize-provided mTLS credentials
- Deploy a Kafka cluster
- Learn how to annotate pods for automatic credentials generation
- Deploy a client connecting to Kafka with mTLS
- Apply intents to configure Kafka ACLs
- Inspect the credentials

:::note
You can skip this section if Otterize is already installed in your cluster.

## Install Otterize
{@include: ../_common/install-otterize.md}


## Install Kafka

We will deploy a Kafka cluster using bitnami's [chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/kafka)
To configure the chart to use the Otterize-provided credentials we need to configure it to
and trust Otterize to configure ACLs:

1. Configure Otterize as a super user to grant it access to configure ACLs
2. Use SSL for it's listeners
3. Tell Otterize using pod annotations how it requires it's credentials
4. Authenticate using mTLS credentials provided as a K8s secret

<details>
<summary>Expand to see the config: `kafka-mtls/helm/values.yaml`</summary>


```yaml
{@include: ../../../static/code-examples/kafka-mtls/helm/values.yaml}
```
</details>

The following command will deploy a Kafka cluster configured to use Otterize-provided mTLS credentials
with permissions for Otterize to configure ACLs.
 ```bash
 helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
 helm upgrade --install --create-namespace -n kafka kafka \
   --version 14.x.x bitnami/kafka \
   -f https://docs.otterize.com/code-examples/kafka-mtls/helm/values.yaml
 ```

<details>
<summary>Optional: check deployment status</summary>
<div>

It can take several minutes for the pods to **stabilize** into the `Ready` and `Running` states. You can monitor with
the following command:

 ```bash
kubectl get pods -n kafka -w
 ```

After **stabilization** you should see:

 ```bash
 NAME                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE
kafka-0             1/1     Running   1 (25s ago)   45s
kafka-zookeeper-0   1/1     Running   0             56s
 ```
</div>
</details>


## Protect a Kafka topic
Let's protect a single kafka topic (`mytopic`) by applying a `KafkaServerConfig` with
```bash
kubectl apply -f https://docs.otterize.com/code-examples/kafka-mtls/kafkaserverconfig.yaml
```
<details>
<summary>Expand to see the details of this example...</summary>
<Tabs>

<TabItem value="kafkaserverconfig.yaml" label="kafkaserverconfig.yaml">

```yaml
{@include: ../../../static/code-examples/kafka-mtls/kafkaserverconfig.yaml}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
</details>

If you check, you should see that an ACL was configured on Kafka to deny anonymous access to the topic

```bash
kubectl logs -n kafka statefulset/kafka | grep "Processing Acl change" | grep mytopic | tail -n 1
   ```
You should see
```
[2022-09-13 10:58:32,052] INFO Processing Acl change notification for ResourcePattern
(resourceType=TOPIC, name=mytopic, patternType=LITERAL), versionedAcls :
Set(User:ANONYMOUS has DENY permission for operations: ALL from hosts: *), zkVersion : 9
(kafka.security.authorizer.AclAuthorizer)
```

## Deploy clients

To generate credentials for the pod we simply need to update the deployment by annotating it.
The required steps are to
1. Annotate the pod - Otterize automatically identifies the `otterize/credentials-secret-name` annotation, generates
mTLS credentials, and stores them as K8s secret named as the annotation value.
2. Mount the credentials stored as a K8s secret as a volume
3. Mount the volume into the container

<details>
    <summary>Expand to see a detailed explanation for the annotations</summary>

    ```yaml
    spec:
    template:
    metadata:
    ...
    annotations:
    # highlight-next-line
    otterize/credentials-secret-name: client-credentials-secret       # 1 Generate credentials
    spec:
    volumes:
    # highlight-start
    - name: otterize-credentials
    secret:
    secretName: client-credentials-secret                         # 2 Mount credentials as a volume
    # highlight-end
    containers:
    - name: client
    ...
    volumeMounts:
    # highlight-start
    - name: otterize-credentials
    mountPath: /var/otterize/credentials                          # 3 Mount volume into container
    readOnly: true
    # highlight-end
    ```
</details>

Our simple example consists of single client pod and a Kafka.

We also deploy a Kafka server config to block access to a specific topic unless intents are set
to allow access. At first, we expect the client to be blocked from accessing the specific topic.
We will follow by applying an intent to allow access.

1. Deploy the client and the Kafka config using `kubectl`.
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f https://docs.otterize.com/code-examples/kafka-mtls/all.yaml
    ```
2. Check that the `client` `pod` was deployed
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n otterize-tutorial-kafka-mtls
   ```
   You should see
   ```
   NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    client-5d9d5c8d7b-7dlzb   1/1     Running   0          24s
   ```

4. Let's monitor the client's attempts to access the Kafka topic with a second terminal window,
   so we can see the effects of our changes in real time.

   **Open a second terminal window** and tail the client log:
   ```bash
   kubectl logs -f --tail 1 -n otterize-tutorial-kafka-mtls deploy/myclient
   ```
   At this point the client should log an error saying it is not authorized to access the topic:
   ```
   Loading mTLS certificates
   Connecting to Kafka
   Creating a producer and a consumer for - mytopic
   Sending messages
   time="2022-09-13T10:41:07Z" level=info error="kafka server: The client is not authorized to access this topic"
   Loop exited
   ```

   This is the expected outcome since we configured Kafka to require intents fo access to this topic.
   Once the client declares its intents, Otterize will add an ACL to Kafka to allow the intended calls.
   Let's see that now...
:::note
Client logs require improvement. Client is compiling on startup so it can take some time before it's ready.
Need to solve this.
:::
## Apply intents
1. The client declares its intent to call the server with this `intents.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
   {@include: ../../../static/code-examples/kafka-mtls/client-intents.yaml}
   ```
:::tip
Client intents are the cornerstone of [intent-based access control](otterize.com/ibac).
:::

   Keep an eye on the logs being tailed in the **second terminal window**
   while you apply this `intents.yaml` file in your **main terminal window** using:
   ```shell
   kubectl apply -f https://docs.otterize.com/code-examples/kafka-mtls/client-intents.yaml
   ```

2. You should quickly see in the **second terminal** that the client is now successfully producing and consuming messages
    ```bash
    kubectl logs --tail=5 -n otterize-tutorial-kafka-mtls deploy/client
    ```
   You should get
    ```bash
    Loading mTLS certificates
    Connecting to Kafka
    Creating a producer and a consumer for - mytopic
    Sending messages
    Sent message - Message 1
    Sent message - Message 2
    Sent message - Message 3
    Sent message - Message 4
    Sent message - Message 5
    Read message - Message 1
    Read message - Message 2
    Read message - Message 3
    Read message - Message 4
    Read message - Message 5
    ```
3. If you check, you should see that an ACL was configured on Kafka
   ```bash
   kubectl logs -n kafka statefulset/kafka | grep "Processing Acl change" | grep mytopic | tail -n 1
   ```
   You should see
   ```
   [2022-09-13 10:44:52,803] INFO Processing Acl change notification for
   ResourcePattern(resourceType=TOPIC, name=mytopic, patternType=LITERAL), 
   versionedAcls : Set(User:ANONYMOUS has DENY permission for operations: 
   ALL from hosts: *, User:CN=myclient.otterize-tutorial-kafka-mtls,O=SPIRE,C=US has ALLOW permission
   for operations: ALL from hosts: *), zkVersion : 6 (kafka.security.authorizer.AclAuthorizer)
   ```

## What's next
- Read about how to gradually rollout [secure access for Kafka](/documentation/guides/ibac-for-k8s-kafka/) on your existing infrastructure.

## What happened behind the scenes

1. We configured the Kafka helm chart to
    1. Use the SSL protocol for its listeners
    2. Annotated its pod to let Otterize know it should generate mTLS credentials in the Java Key Store and Java Trust
       Store format and store them as a K8s secret.
    3. Use the K8s secret for mTLS by configuring Kafka's auth mechanism.
2. We annotated the client pod to let Otterize know it should generate mTLS credentials in a PEM format.
3. The Otterize SPIRE integration operator
   1. Created an entry for the annotated client pod with the SPIRE server.
   2. Generated matching mTLS credentials using the SPIRE server.
   3. Stored the mTLS credentials into a K8s secrets.
4. The secret was mounted into the client pod's container.
5. We configured Kafka to only allow intended access to the specific topic.
6. The client pod connected and authenticated to Kafka using mTLS but couldn't access the topic.
7. We applied intents to allow the client to access the topic.
8. The client pod connected and authenticated to Kafka using mTLS but and accessed the topic successfully.
