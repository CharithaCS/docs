These guides take you through [installing](/documentation/4-guides/1-k8s-installation.mdx) and using Otterize.

They are oriented to solving specific use cases,
such as
- [automatically controlling K8s pod-to-pod access via network policies](/documentation/4-guides/2-k8s-ibac-via-network-policies/README.mdx),
- [easily and securely accessing Kafka with mTLS and ACLs](/documentation/4-guides/3-ibac-for-k8s-kafka/README.mdx).
- [mapping service-to-service calls in your K8s cluster, and bootstrapping intents files](/documentation/4-guides/4-k8s-mapping-pod-to-pod-calls.mdx),
- [rolling out mTLS for pod-to-pod authentication](/documentation/4-guides/5-k8s-mtls.mdx), and

By following these guides, you will learn not only how to take an intent-based approach to streamlining access control,
but also how to **bootstrap** intents files to get your team started,
and **gradually roll it out** service-by-service or team-by-team.
