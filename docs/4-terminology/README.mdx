# Terminology

An overview of the terminology used in Otterize OSS documentation.
If you think a term is missing here, please [let us know](https://github.com/otterize/docs/issues/new).

## Basics

### Service
An Otterize service is either a client or a server, and is referred to by client intents. [Learn how service identity resolution happens](/service-identities).

### CLI
The Otterize CLI is a command-line utility used to control and interact with the Otterize network mapper, manipulate local Intents files, and (coming soon!) interact with Otterize Cloud.

## Identity

### PKI
PKI stands for public key infrastructure, and refers to the infrastructure used to provision X.509 credentials, in our case - used for mTLS.

### mTLS
mTLS stands for mutual TLS, and is a form of TLS where both the client and server are authenticated - or in other words, TLS with mutual authentication.

In regular TLS, only the server is authenticated - such as when you connect to google.com, and your browser authenticates google.com using its certificate, but google.com does not authenticate you as the client with your certificate.

## Enforcement

### Network Policies
Kubernetes network policies can be used to control network access between pods in a Kubernetes cluster, and require the installation of a Kubernetes network plugin that supports network policy enforcement. One commonly supported CNI is Calico. [Read more about network policies in the official documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/).

### Kafka ACLs
Kafka ACLs stand for Access Control Lists, a built-in mechanism in Kafka for authorizing access to Kafka resources such as topics. [Read more about Kafka ACLs in the official documentation](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/kafka/authorization.html#authorization-using-acls).
