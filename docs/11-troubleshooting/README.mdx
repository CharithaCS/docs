This section will be filled out soon, once we have a better notion of what issues people are likely to encounter.

For now, this is a bit of a grab-bag.
:::

- Kubernetes Pod status
  - My pod is stuck on **ContainerCreating**
    - Describe the Pod (i.e. `kubectl describe`) and consult the Events section:
      - **MountVolume.SetUp** failed for volume "otterize-credentials" : secret "XXX" not found
      
          Credentials were not generated and stored in the K8s `secret`. Please verify
          - Otterize is installed with the **SPIRE integration operator** enabled.
          - Pod is annotated with `spire-integration.otterize.com/tls-secret-name`.
