title: Terminology

An overview of the terminology used in Otterize OSS documentation.
If you think a term is missing here, please [let us know](https://github.com/otterize/docs/issues/new).

## Basics

### Service
An Otterize service is either a client or a server, and is referred to by client intents. [Learn how service identity resolution happens](/service-identities).

### CLI
The Otterize CLI is a command-line utility used to control and interact with the Otterize network mapper, manipulate local Intents files, and (coming soon!) interact with Otterize Cloud.

## Identity

### PKI
PKI stands for public key infrastructure, and refers to the infrastructure used to provision X.509 credentials.
 A common use case for PKI is to support mTLS.

### mTLS
mTLS stands for mutual TLS, and is a form of TLS where both the client and server mutually authenticate to each other.
In other words, mTLS is mutual TLS.

In regular TLS, only the server is authenticated. For example, when you connect to google.com, a
nd your browser authenticates google.com using its certificate, you're using TLS;
but google.com does not authenticate you, as the client, with a certificate, so the communication isn't using mTLS, just TLS.

### SPIRE
An open-source system that implements the [SPIFFE](https://github.com/spiffe/spire) specification. Used for workload attestation and credential management.
[Read more about SPIRE in the official documentation](https://spiffe.io/docs/latest/spire-about/).
### SPIRE integration operator
The Otterize SPIRE integration operator automatically resolves pods to dev-friendly service names, registers them with a SPIRE server, and provisions credentials as a Kubernetes Secrets.

## Enforcement

### Network Policies
Kubernetes network policies can be used to control network access between pods in a Kubernetes cluster.
To do so they require the installation of a Kubernetes CNI network plugin that supports network policy enforcement.
One commonly supported CNI is Calico.
[Read more about network policies in the official documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/).

### Kafka ACLs
ACLs stand for Access Control Lists, a built-in mechanism in Kafka (and other systems) for authorizing access
to Kafka resources such as topics.
[Read more about Kafka ACLs in the official documentation](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/kafka/authorization.html#authorization-using-acls).
